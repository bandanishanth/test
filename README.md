# Jekyll Now with Bootstrap 4

In addition to the original features, this version includes some more features which I needed in multiple projects. Bootstrap is just handy.

## Features

- Uses [Bootstrap]([https://getbootstrap.com](https://getbootstrap.com/)) `4.3.1` layout.

- Supports **categories** as a [collection](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/collections/):
  - Each category gets a `/category/:name` page with meta-data.
  - `/category` lists all categories, along with all articles under them so far.
  
- Supports **authors** as a collection:
  - Each author gets a `/authors/:name` page with social links and bio.
  - `/authors` lists all authors. For now.
  
- Includes `/_data`, currently used for navigation links only.
  
  > This one isn't a "necessary" addition but allows for much freedom in the long run.
  > Or so I think ðŸ™Œ
  
- Supports Profile Pictures, which falls back to a placeholder avatar with custom initials set in the author's markdown file.

- Plugins used:
  - `jekyll-paginate`: Pagination as `/articles/:num/`
  - `jekyll-mentions`: Support for mentions, defaulting to Twitter.
  - `jekyll-redirect-from`: Support for redirecting pages. Must-have, really.
  - `jekyll-gist`: Supports for gists.
  
- Basic styling options with Sass variables:
  - `primary-light` & `primary-dark`.
  - `accent`: This is the only one I've used everywhere.
  
- Layout options:
  - [`default`](https://github.com/AjitZero/jekyll-now-bs4/blob/master/_layouts/default.html): Includes the navigation and footer.
  - [`jumbo-section`](https://github.com/AjitZero/jekyll-now-bs4/blob/master/_layouts/jumbo-section.html): Adds a hero navigation jumbotron component from bootstrap.
  - [`none`](https://github.com/AjitZero/jekyll-now-bs4/blob/master/_layouts/none.html): For truly independent pages.
  - [`page`](https://github.com/AjitZero/jekyll-now-bs4/blob/master/_layouts/page.html): Standard go-to page template.
  - [`standalone`](https://github.com/AjitZero/jekyll-now-bs4/blob/master/_layouts/standalone.html): Includes default setup with `<main>`.

------

### Notes

- This is by default no longer meant for *user* or *organisation* websites, like `<username/org-name>.github.io`, unlike how Jekyll Now was made. However, it can be easily be made to do support that.

- For *project* websites, update `baseurl` in `_config.yml` as the repository name.

  **e.g.** If the name of the repository is assumed to be `repo` then the `baseurl` should be set as `/repo`, while the website can be viewed on `<username/org-name>.github.io/repo/`.

- **Removed** Disqus related code.

  > This part can be easily restored from [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now). I don't ever use it though.

- `jekyll-avatar` was added, then **removed** later due to [this issue](https://github.com/benbalter/jekyll-avatar/issues/37).

- `/articles/index.html` is needed instead of a simpler `/articles.md` since `jekyll-paginate` requires an `index.html` file. No support for `*.md` ðŸ˜”
